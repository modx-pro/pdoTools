Small library for creating fast snippets for MODX Revolution that works through PDO.

Required by Tickets and miniShop2.

Main features
- Builds queries with xPDO.
- Retrieve results with PDO.
- Improved pdoTools::getChunk() function, that processing placeholders faster, than original modX::getChunk().

pdoTools snippets will work so faster, than more fields you will retrieve from database at one query.
